Hi there! 👋

I`m **Daria**, a Python developer and 4th year IT student @ [Vilnius University](https://www.vu.lt/en/). 

Previously, I worked as **QA Test Engineer, Simulations Engineer and Python Developer Intern** @ [Kongsberg NanoAvionics](https://nanoavionics.com/), where I developed optimization algorithms, automated workflows, and conducted in-depth data analysis.

I have a diverse skill set, including proficiency in **Python, R, SQL, Java,** and **JavaScript**, as well as frameworks like TensorFlow, Django, and React.js. My toolset includes Git, Docker, AWS, and more. My work often involves leveraging data analysis, machine learning, and developing RESTful APIs.

Outside of work, I follow the latest developments in science, enjoy playing video games and creating digital art.

**Let's connect!** 🚀
